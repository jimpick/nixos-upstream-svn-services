To install the Subversion server.

1. Grab the latest Nixpkgs:

     svn co https://svn.cs.uu.nl:12443/repos/trace/nixpkgs/trunk/pkgs

   (Or create a symlink `pkgs' to the `pkgs' subdirectory of some
   Nixpkgs installation you already have.)

2. To speed up building of the server:

     nix-pull http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/dist/nix/channels-v3/nixpkgs-unstable/MANIFEST

3. Modify `svn-server-conf.nix' to set site-specific settings.  To set
   up a https server, create a server certificate and key (see ssl/README).

4. Build the test instance of the server:

     ./upgrade-server test

   If succesful, the server will run on port 12081 by default.

5. Set a password for the `root' user:

     /nix/var/nix/profiles/svn-test-server/bin/resetpw.pl root PASSWORD

6. If the test server works, build the production instance:

     ./upgrade-server production

   The production instance will run op port 12080 by default.


Anytime you make a configuration change, you should first upgrade the
test server instance, then the production server instance
(`./upgrade-server (test|production)').


To stop the server:

  /nix/var/nix/profiles/svn-(test|production)-server/bin/ctl stop

To start the server:

  /nix/var/nix/profiles/svn-(test|production)-server/bin/ctl start

(This is done automatically by `./upgrade-server'.)


There are some utility commands in
/nix/var/nix/profiles/svn-(test|production)-server/bin:

* `resetpw.pl USERNAME PASSWORD' resets a user's password.

* `delete-repo.pl TRASH REPONAMES...' moves the specified repositories
  to the directory TRASH.

* `delete-user.pl USERNAME' deletes a user, after checking that the
  user no longer is the owner of any repository and does not occur in
  any ACL.
